# Phonebook Application

## Project Overview

The Phonebook Application is a web application designed to manage a list of contacts efficiently. Users can add, update, and delete contacts, as well as search for specific contacts by name. This application demonstrates the use of modern web development technologies.

## Features

- **Add New Contacts**: Users can add new contacts with a name and phone number.
- **Update Contacts**: Users can update the phone number of existing contacts.
- **Delete Contacts**: Users can delete contacts from the phonebook.
- **Search Contacts**: Users can filter the list of contacts by name.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the server.
- **JSON Server**: A simple and quick backend for prototyping and testing.
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: Markup and styling of the application.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The programming language used for logic and functionality.

## Important Concepts

- **State Management**: Use of React's `useState` hook to manage component state.
- **Effect Hook**: Use of React's `useEffect` hook to fetch initial data from the server.
- **Axios for HTTP Requests**: Use of Axios to handle HTTP requests for creating, reading, updating, and deleting contacts.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Rendering UI elements based on the application state and user actions.

## Future Enhancements

- **User Authentication**: Adding authentication to protect user data.
- **Advanced Validation**: Adding more robust validation for input fields.
- **Enhanced UI/UX**: Improving the user interface and user experience.
- **Pagination**: Implementing pagination for handling large lists of contacts.
- **Responsive Design**: Making the application fully responsive across different devices.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/phonebook-app.git
   cd phonebook-app

   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

```sh
npm install
```

3. **Start json server**:

```sh
npm run server
```

4. **Start the React development server**:
